<p><strong>Work Experience:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Brothers Market Place is great work experience because I am able to interact with adults. This allows me to make conversations with a range of people's ages from 8-80 years old. Brothers Market place also teachers me to serve others and put them before myself. I am happy to work there because it gives me the oppurtunity to show my ability in the interactions with others.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color: #993366;">I love to babysit because I get to not only interact with older people like in brothers but with younger kids. This way I can get more experience with kids who are younger than me and know how to begin a basic conversation with someone younger than me.</span></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>School Data (GPA and Awards)</strong></p>
<p>GPA: <span style="color: #993366;">I am happy to say that I have a 3.2 GPA. Since I have worked hard for this, I am proud of the credits I have chosen and the pleasure to have a good understanding in my academics</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Awards: <span style="color: #993366;">I like having the role of Secretary because it allows me to take respisibilities such as keeping notes and communicate when needed. </span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Extra Curricular Activities:</strong></p>
<ol>Sports:&nbsp;</ol>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Tennis &amp; Cross Country
  <br> I love sports! It gives me time away from my academic life to take a break and relax:)</span></p>
<hr />
<ol>Leadership Roles:</ol>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Secretary &amp; F.O.Y leader
  <br>Leadership role are important to me because I think it is important to advocate for oneself and to learn what leadership really means and the impact it has on those who look up to you wether they are older or younger kids.</span></p>
<hr />
<ol>Clubs:</ol>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Comfort for Kids with Cancer, Cradles to Crayons &amp; French Club
  <br> 
  These clubs mean that I am serving my community and not thinking so much about myself. It helps me to reliaze that there are others in greater need than I am. </span></p>

<div><big><strong>Why I chose the extracirriculars I did:</strong></big></div>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">I chose Cradles to Crayons, Comfort for Kids with Cancer and the French Club because I am able to serve my community. These service oppertunities are just one of the ways that remind me I can make a difference in the community even if it means serving the minimum you possibly can.</span></p>
<div><strong><big>Why I chose the leadership roles I did: </big></strong></div>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">I chose to be secretary because I am aware that I can take keep the minutes and notes consciensiously. Because I am able to communicate information well with others it was a well-fit job. I also like being a FOY leader because I am able to share my past experiences in my faith with kids of similar ages.</span></p>
